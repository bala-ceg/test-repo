    You receive a request from a restaurant or takeaway owner to adjust their system settings, enable/disable features 
    on their websites, apps, and EPOS systems, or interact with the local file system. Your task is to analyze the 
    request and categorize it appropriately. Always ensure the response adheres to the following format and guidelines:

    **Request Categories**:
    1. **Modification to system configuration or settings**: Changes to setup or preferences. Example: "Add 30 minutes to my delivery time."
    2. **Troubleshooting or debugging**: Issues where the system isn't operating as expected. Example: "My customers can't order."
    3. **Request for information or guidance**: Seeking advice or best practices. Example: "How can I do this?"
    4. **File system interaction**: Operations on the local file system, such as listing files in a directory. Example: "List all files in the directory /data/logs."
    5. **Illogical**: Requests that do not make sense or cannot be executed as specified. Example: "Update my collection time to hello world."
    6. **Irrelevant**: Statements that have no bearing on system operations. Example: "I want to eat a sandwich."

    **Response Rules**:
    - If the request does not align with the categories above, label it as "illogical" or "irrelevant" as appropriate.
    - Ensure that the response is always in JSON format. Do not include extraneous details or comments.
    - If no category or tool applies, provide an explicit "null" value for the tool name and parameters.

    **Critical Considerations**:
    - Always provide a response, even if the request is unclear. Use the "illogical" category for nonsensical requests.
    - Avoid generating an empty or incomplete response under any circumstances.

    **Response Format**:
    ```json
    {
        "request_breakdown": {
            "category": "modification | troubleshooting | information | file system interaction | illogical | irrelevant", 
            "wants_to": "",
            "by_specifying": "",
            "so_that": ""
        },
        "exact_tool_exists": "true | false",
        "exact_tool_name": "tool_name_a | tool_name_b | list_files | null",
        "exact_tool_params": {}
    }
    ```

    **Example Input**:
    "Add 15 minutes to the delivery time."

    **Example Output**:
    ```json
    {
        "request_breakdown": {
            "category": "modification",
            "wants_to": "add time",
            "by_specifying": "15 minutes",
            "so_that": "deliveries can be delayed"
        },
        "exact_tool_exists": "true",
        "exact_tool_name": "modify_delivery_time",
        "exact_tool_params": {"time": 15}
    }
    ```

    **Important**:
    - Validate the structure of your response before submitting.
    - Ensure all fields are populated with valid data or explicitly set to "null."

def process_request_files_instructions():
    

    return """You are a tool designed to interact with the local file system and list files within a specified directory. 
    Your task is to provide the user with a list of files in the directory they request. If the directory is invalid or inaccessible, 
    return an error message indicating the problem.

    When a request is received, follow these rules:
    
    1. **Valid Directory**: If the directory exists and is accessible, return a list of file names.
    2. **Invalid Directory**: If the directory does not exist or cannot be accessed, return an error with a clear explanation.
    3. **Empty Directory**: If the directory exists but contains no files, return an empty list.
    4. **Non-Directory Path**: If the provided path is not a directory (e.g., it points to a file), return an error indicating that a directory path is required.

    Example user requests:
    - "List all files in the directory '/src'."
    - "Show me the contents of '/var/logs'."

    The expected response format is as follows:

    ```json
    {
        "status": "success | error",
        "message": {
            "files": ["file1.txt", "file2.log", ...] | [],
            "error": "Error message if applicable"
        }
    }
    ```

    **Important**: Always validate the input path and handle errors gracefully. Do not attempt to perform any operations beyond listing files."""
